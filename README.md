# ADAGE - ADaptive Analysis of Genetic Elements

This ensemble model combines CNN's with chromosomal locations and genomic graph traversals to identify transcription factors ("activator genes") that are responsible for specific cellular functions (such as CNS neuron regeneration, or suppression for a specific type of tumor).

Presented at the 2019 Canada-Wide Science Fair, and at the 2019 Sanofi Biogenius (Canadian Final).

### Quickstart

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

### Potential Runtime Issues

Note: as of January 4, 2023, there are potential runtime issues due to Python dependency versioning and internal model dimension changes.

Please feel free to report any runtime errors via Issues on the GitHub repo.

Thank you in advance!
